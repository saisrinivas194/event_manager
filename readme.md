### 1. ![Missing Required Data in User Fixtures] (https://github.com/saisrinivas194/event_manager/issues/2)

**Issue:** The `conftest.py` fixtures lacked required fields, causing tests like `test_user_base_valid` to fail.

**Resolution:**
- Added the `nickname` field to the base user fixture.
- Incorporated the `first_name` field in the `user_update_data` fixture.
- Ensured all fixtures align with test requirements and API expectations.

---

### 2. ![Implemented User ID Validation Using UUID] (https://github.com/saisrinivas194/event_manager/issues/3)

**Issue:** Tests failed because the `id` field in the UserResponse schema required a UUID format, but the fixture lacked it.

**Resolution:**
- Updated the `conftest.py` fixture to generate UUID values for the `id` field.
- Ensured all relevant tests adhere to schema requirements for the `id` field.

---

### 3. ![Resolved Validation Error for Login Request] (https://github.com/saisrinivas194/event_manager/issues/5)

**Issue:** Tests for LoginRequest validation failed due to a missing `email` field in the fixture.

**Resolution:**
- Added the `email` field to the `login_request_data` fixture.
- Ensured the fixture aligns with API validation requirements, allowing tests to pass successfully.

---

### 4. ![Fixture Failed SMTP Connection] (https://github.com/saisrinivas194/event_manager/issues/7)

**Issue:** Email-related tests failed due to improper SMTP configuration.

**Resolution:**
- Configured Mailtrap credentials in the test environment.
- Verified SMTP connection to ensure successful execution of email-related tests.

---

### 5. ![Implemented Email Validation] (https://github.com/saisrinivas194/event_manager/issues/9)

**Issue:** Email fields lacked proper validation, allowing invalid formats to be accepted.

**Resolution:**
- Added regex-based validation to enforce standard email formats.
- Wrote comprehensive test cases to handle various email scenarios, including edge cases.

---

### 6. ![Cleaned Up User-Related Files] (https://github.com/saisrinivas194/event_manager/issues/11)

**Issue:** User-related files contained unused variables, duplicate imports, and redundant fields.

**Resolution:**
- Removed unused variables and reorganized imports for better clarity.
- Fixed duplicate field issues in `userListResponse`.
- Addressed duplicate test names to prevent conflicts and enhance maintainability.
- Improved error handling for edge cases.

---

### 7. ![Build and Publish Image to DockerHub] (https://github.com/saisrinivas194/event_manager/issues/13)

**Issue:** The CI/CD pipeline needed updates to publish the Docker image to DockerHub.

**Resolution:**
- Updated the DockerHub repository to point to a personal profile for improved management.
- Configured GitHub Actions to:
  - Include environment variables for email service during pytest.
  - Build and publish Docker images upon successful test execution.
- Addressed vulnerabilities in dependencies (e.g., Gunicorn) to ensure enhanced security and stability.
- Enhanced test fixture files to align with updated requirements and improve accuracy.
